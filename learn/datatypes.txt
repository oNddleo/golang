Golang has integer types called byte and rune that are aliases for uint8 and int32 data types, respectively.

In Go, the byte and rune data types are used to distinguish characters from integer values.

In Go, there is no char data type. It uses byte and rune to represent character values.

The byte data type represents ASCII characters while the rune data type represents a more broader set of Unicode characters that are encoded in UTF-8 format.
