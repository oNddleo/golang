Define
    - A map is an unordered collection of key-value pairs

Declaring a map
    var m map[string]int

Initializing a map
    var m = make(map[string]int)

Initializing a map using a map literal
    var m = map[string]int{
        "one": 1,
        "two": 2,
        "three": 3,
    }
Deleting a key from a map
    delete(map, key)

Maps are reference types
    Maps are reference types. When you assign a map to a new variable, they both refer to the same underlying data structure. Therefore changes done by one variable will be visible to the other

Iterating over a map
    You can iterate over a map using range form of the for loop. It gives you the key, value pair in every iteration
