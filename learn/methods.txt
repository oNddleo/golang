Go Methods
    A method is nothing but a function with a special receiver argument
Methods are functions
    Since a method is just a function with a receiver argument

Why Methods instead of Functions?
    Methods help you write object-oriented style code in Go. Method calls are much easier to read and understand than function calls.

    Moreover, Methods help you avoid naming conflicts. Since a method is tied to a particular receiver, you can have the same method names on different receiver types.

Method definition restrictions
    Note that, For you to be able to define a method on a receiver, the receiver type must be defined in the same package.
    Go doesnâ€™t allow you to define a method on a receiver type that is defined in some other package (this includes built-in types such as int as well).
    In all the previous examples, the structs and the methods were defined in the same package main. Therefore, they worked. However, if you try to define a method on a type defined in some other package, the compiler will complain
