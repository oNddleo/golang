A struct is a user-defined type that contains a collection of named fields/properties. It is used to group related data together to form a single unit. Any real-world entity that has a set of properties can be represented using a struct

Defining a struct type
    type Person struct {
        FirstName string
        LastName  string
        Age       int
    }

Creating a struct and obtaining a pointer to it using the built-in new() function

Exported vs Unexported Structs and Struct Fields
    Any struct type that starts with a capital letter is exported and accessible from outside packages. Similarly, any struct field that starts with a capital letter is exported.

Structs are value types
    Structs are value types. When you assign one struct variable to another, a new copy of the struct is created and assigned. Similarly, when you pass a struct to another function, the function gets its own copy of the struct

Struct Equality
    Two struct variables are equal if all their corresponding fields are equal
